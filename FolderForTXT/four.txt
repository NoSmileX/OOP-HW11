Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has arrived at the White House to meet
with US President Joe Biden. He was greeted by Biden and first lady Jill Biden.

The two leaders are scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting.

This is Zelensky's first foreign trip since the war began. The Ukrainian president was clad
in his typical green-colored cargo pants and a sweatshirt with a small insignia of
Ukraine's coat of arms on it.
